%h3 About
%p This was inspired by all the tweets (and more recently the re-discovery of reddit posts, which I pretty much serves much the same purpose) that I see go by that are calling out dumb behavior, false information, and general trollery. Now there will be a central suppository for calling out these falsehoods and lamery. Eventually we will save IDs and have a discussion about these claims but initially, I just want a count of how bullshit something is. 
%p And yes I expect it to be wildly abused.
